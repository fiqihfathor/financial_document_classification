- **Git**: Install Git to clone the repository and manage version control. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

- **UV**: An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust. You can read the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

- **CUDA (optional)**: If you plan to use GPU acceleration for model training, ensure your system has a compatible NVIDIA GPU and CUDA toolkit installed. You can download CUDA from [developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).

Once you have these prerequisites set up, you're ready to proceed with the installation and setup of the project.
